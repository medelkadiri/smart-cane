# Project description



The purpose of the **smart cane** project is to develop a **device mounted on a cane** that **helps visually impaired people** **avoid obstacles** **while walking**, and **alerts relatives**(partner, friends, family members, etc.) if the **cane user falls off**.



There are **two sensors** used:



* Time of Flight **Micro-LIDAR Distance** sensor for precise **obstacle detection**.



* IMU**(Inertial Measurement Unit)** sensor for **fall detection** using **acceleration(Accelerometer)** and **direction(Gyroscope)** **change** through **X,Y, and Z** which is a total of **6 axes of measurements**.



# Hardware Used



* 1x STM32 Nucleo-64 development board with STM32F401RE MCU.
* 1x Adafruit TDK InvenSense ICM-20948 9-DoF IMU.
* 1x Adafruit VL53L0X Time of Flight Micro-LIDAR Distance Sensor.
* Multiple piezo buzzers \& audio indicators 12mmx9.5mm 5 V, 85 dB, Through Hole, Indicator.
* Multiple LEDs, resistors, transistors, and jumper wires.
* 1x Breadboard.
